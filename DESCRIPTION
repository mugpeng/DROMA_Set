Description: DROMA_Set provides a comprehensive framework for managing and analyzing 
    drug response and omics data across multiple projects. The package implements 
    two main S4 classes: DromaSet for single-project analysis and MultiDromaSet 
    for cross-project comparisons. It includes robust database connectivity, 
    metadata management, sample overlap detection, and flexible data loading 
    capabilities for various molecular profile types (mRNA, CNV, mutations, etc.) 
    and treatment response data.
