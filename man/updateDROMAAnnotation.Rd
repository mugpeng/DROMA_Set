\arguments{
\item{anno_type}{Character, type of annotation to update: "sample" or "drug"}

\item{name_mapping}{Data frame with name mappings containing at minimum: original_name, new_name, match_confidence columns}

\item{project_name}{Character, the project name to assign to new entries}

\item{data_type}{Character or character vector, the data type(s) to assign to new sample entries (e.g., "CellLine", "PDC", "PDX"). Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (only for sample annotations)}

\item{tumor_type}{Character or character vector, the tumor type(s) to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{PatientID}{Character or character vector, the patient ID(s) to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{Gender}{Character or character vector, the gender(s) to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{Age}{Numeric or numeric vector, the age(s) to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{FullEthnicity}{Character or character vector, the full ethnicity/ethnicities to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{SimpleEthnicity}{Character or character vector, the simple ethnicity/ethnicities to assign to new sample entries. Can be a single value (applied to all) or a vector matching the length of name_mapping (default: NA, only for sample annotations)}

\item{connection}{Optional database connection object. If NULL, uses global connection}

\value{
Invisibly returns TRUE if successful, along with a summary of changes

\description{
Adds harmonized sample or drug names to the corresponding annotation tables.
Processes all entries from the name_mapping dataframe. For high confidence matches,
uses existing annotation information when available. Creates new entries with new_name
as the primary identifier and original_name recorded in ProjectRawName. Updates existing
entries if they already exist in the database.
